    <div class="about-card">
        <p>
            I was born on October 21, 2000, in Baku, Azerbaijan.
            From an early age, I showed a strong interest in computers and technology,
            which later influenced my educational and career path.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2017, after successfully graduating from school, I was admitted to the
            National Aviation Academy, where I studied Electronics, Radio Engineering,
            and Telecommunications Engineering. I completed my bachelor’s degree in 2021.
        </p>

        <p>
            After that, I continued my education by enrolling in a master’s program at
            Azerbaijan Technical University, specializing in Electronic Devices Engineering.
            I graduated with a strong academic performance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Following my graduation, I completed one year of mandatory military service.
            After finishing my service, I decided to pursue a new professional direction
            and focus on software development.
        </p>

        <p>
            To achieve this goal, I applied to Step IT Academy, where I am currently studying
            programming and improving my skills in modern technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since August 2021, I have been working at <strong>Bakı Abadlıq Xidməti MMC</strong>.
            The only break in my professional career was during my military service,
            after which I returned to my position and continued my work.
        </p>

        <p class="about-highlight">
            At the moment, I am actively exploring the field of programming and
            aim to start my career as a software developer in the near future.
